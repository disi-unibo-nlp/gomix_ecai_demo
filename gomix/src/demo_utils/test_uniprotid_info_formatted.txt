Integrin alpha-IIB/beta-3 (ITGA2B:ITGB3) is a receptor for fibronectin, fibrinogen, plasminogen, prothrombin, thrombospondin and vitronectin. Integrins alpha-IIB/beta-3 and alpha-V/beta-3 recognize the sequence R-G-D in a wide array of ligands. Integrin alpha-IIB/beta-3 recognizes the sequence H-H-L-G-G-G-A-K-Q-A-G-D-V in fibrinogen gamma chain. Following activation integrin alpha-IIB/beta-3 brings about platelet/platelet interaction through binding of soluble fibrinogen. This step leads to rapid platelet aggregation which physically plugs ruptured endothelial surfaces. Fibrinogen binding enhances SELP expression in activated platelets (PubMed:19332769). ITGAV:ITGB3 binds to fractalkine (CX3CL1) and acts as its coreceptor in CX3CR1-dependent fractalkine signaling. ITGAV:ITGB3 binds to NRG1 (via EGF domain) and this binding is essential for NRG1-ERBB signaling. ITGAV:ITGB3 binds to FGF1 and this binding is essential for FGF1 signaling. ITGAV:ITGB3 binds to FGF2 and this binding is essential for FGF2 signaling (By similarity). ITGAV:ITGB3 binds to IGF1 and this binding is essential for IGF1 signaling (By similarity). ITGAV:ITGB3 binds to IGF2 and this binding is essential for IGF2 signaling (By similarity). ITGAV:ITGB3 binds to IL1B and this binding is essential for IL1B signaling (By similarity). ITGAV:ITGB3 binds to PLA2G2A via a site (site 2) which is distinct from the classical ligand-binding site (site 1) and this induces integrin conformational changes and enhanced ligand binding to site 1 (By similarity). ITGAV:ITGB3 acts as a receptor for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) and mediates R-G-D-dependent cell adhesion to FBN1 (By similarity). ITGAV:ITGB3 binds to the Lilrb4a/Gp49b receptor and enhances the Lilrb4a-mediated inhibition of mast cell activation (PubMed:11323698). ITGAV:ITGB3 also suppresses marginal zone B cell antibody production through its interaction with Lilrb4a (PubMed:24935931). In brain, plays a role in synaptic transmission and plasticity (PubMed:18549786, PubMed:29038237). Involved in the regulation of the serotonin neurotransmission, is required to localize to specific compartments within the synapse the serotonin receptor SLC6A4 and for an appropriate reuptake of serotonin (PubMed:29038237). Controls excitatory synaptic strength by regulating GRIA2-containing AMPAR endocytosis, which affects AMPAR abundance and composition (PubMed:18549786). ITGAV:ITGB3 act as a receptor for CD40LG (By similarity). ITGAV:ITGB3 acts as a receptor for IBSP and promotes cell adhesion and migration to IBSP (By similarity)"

A number of activities have been described for this dioxygenase, but recent results suggest that it mainly acts on tRNAs and mediates their demethylation or oxidation depending on the context and subcellular compartment (By similarity). Mainly acts as a tRNA demethylase by removing N(1)-methyladenine from various tRNAs, with a preference for N(1)-methyladenine at position 58 (m1A58) present on a stem loop structure of tRNAs (PubMed:27745969). Acts as a regulator of translation initiation and elongation in response to glucose deprivation: regulates both translation initiation, by mediating demethylation of tRNA(Met), and translation elongation, N(1)-methyladenine-containing tRNAs being preferentially recruited to polysomes to promote translation elongation (By similarity). In mitochondrion, specifically interacts with mt-tRNA(Met) and mediates oxidation of mt-tRNA(Met) methylated at cytosine(34) to form 5-formylcytosine (f(5)c) at this position (By similarity). mt-tRNA(Met) containing the f(5)c modification at the wobble position enables recognition of the AUA codon in addition to the AUG codon, expanding codon recognition in mitochondrial translation (By similarity). Specifically demethylates DNA methylated on the 6th position of adenine (N(6)-methyladenosine) DNA (PubMed:27027282). N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) DNA is present at some L1 elements in embryonic stem cells and probably promotes their silencing (PubMed:27027282).

Also has DNA lyase activity and introduces double-stranded breaks at abasic sites: cleaves both single-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA at abasic sites, with the greatest activity towards double-stranded DNA with two abasic sites (By similarity). DNA lyase activity does not require alpha-ketoglutarate and iron and leads to the formation of an irreversible covalent protein-DNA adduct with the 5' DNA product (By similarity). DNA lyase activity is not required during base excision repair and class switch recombination of the immunoglobulin heavy chain during B lymphocyte activation (PubMed:23825659).

The CPC complex has essential functions at the centromere in ensuring correct chromosome alignment and segregation and is required for chromatin-induced microtubule stabilization and spindle assembly (By similarity). Involved in the bipolar attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochores and is a key regulator for the onset of cytokinesis during mitosis (By similarity). Required for central/midzone spindle assembly and cleavage furrow formation (By similarity). Key component of the cytokinesis checkpoint, a process required to delay abscission to prevent both premature resolution of intercellular chromosome bridges and accumulation of DNA damage: phosphorylates CHMP4C, leading to retain abscission-competent VPS4 (VPS4A and/or VPS4B) at the midbody ring until abscission checkpoint signaling is terminated at late cytokinesis (By similarity). AURKB phosphorylates the CPC complex subunits BIRC5/survivin, CDCA8/borealin and INCENP (By similarity). Phosphorylation of INCENP leads to increased AURKB activity (By similarity). Other known AURKB substrates involved in centromeric functions and mitosis are CENPA, DES/desmin, GPAF, KIF2C, NSUN2, RACGAP1, SEPTIN1, VIM/vimentin, HASPIN, and histone H3 (By similarity). A positive feedback loop involving HASPIN and AURKB contributes to localization of CPC to centromeres (By similarity). Phosphorylation of VIM controls vimentin filament segregation in cytokinetic process, whereas histone H3 is phosphorylated at 'Ser-10' and 'Ser-28' during mitosis (H3S10ph and H3S28ph, respectively) (PubMed:11784863). AURKB is also required for kinetochore localization of BUB1 and SGO1 (By similarity). Phosphorylation of p53/TP53 negatively regulates its transcriptional activity (By similarity). Key regulator of active promoters in resting B- and T-lymphocytes: acts by mediating phosphorylation of H3S28ph at active promoters in resting B-cells, inhibiting RNF2/RING1B-mediated ubiquitination of histone H2A and enhancing binding and activity of the USP16 deubiquitinase at transcribed genes (PubMed:24034696). Acts as an inhibitor of CGAS during mitosis: catalyzes phosphorylation of the N-terminus of CGAS during the G2-M transition, blocking CGAS liquid phase separation and activation, and thereby preventing CGAS-induced autoimmunity (By similarity). Phosphorylates KRT5 during anaphase and telophase (PubMed:29518391). Phosphorylates ATXN10 which promotes phosphorylation of ATXN10 by PLK1 and may play a role in the regulation of cytokinesis and stimulating the proteasomal degradation of ATXN10 (By similarity)"

Acts as a catalyst in the formation of hyaluronan-HC oligomers and hyaluronan-rich matrix surrounding the cumulus cell-oocyte complex, a necessary step for oocyte fertilization (PubMed:12668637). Assembles hyaluronan in pericellular matrices that serve as platforms for receptor clustering and signaling. Enables binding of hyaluronan deposited on the surface of macrophages to LYVE1 on lymphatic endothelium and facilitates macrophage extravasation. Alters hyaluronan binding to functionally latent CD44 on vascular endothelium, switching CD44 into an active state that supports leukocyte rolling (By similarity).

    "description": "Probable core component of the endosomal sorting required for transport complex III (ESCRT-III) which is involved in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) formation and sorting of endosomal cargo proteins into MVBs. MVBs contain intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are generated by invagination and scission from the limiting membrane of the endosome and mostly are delivered to lysosomes enabling degradation of membrane proteins, such as stimulated growth factor receptors, lysosomal enzymes and lipids. The MVB pathway appears to require the sequential function of ESCRT-O, -I,-II and -III complexes. ESCRT-III proteins mostly dissociate from the invaginating membrane before the ILV is released. The ESCRT machinery also functions in topologically equivalent membrane fission events, such as the terminal stages of cytokinesis. Together with SPAST, the ESCRT-III complex promotes nuclear envelope sealing and mitotic spindle disassembly during late anaphase. Plays a role in the endosomal sorting pathway. ESCRT-III proteins are believed to mediate the necessary vesicle extrusion and/or membrane fission activities, possibly in conjunction with the AAA ATPase VPS4. When overexpressed, membrane-assembled circular arrays of CHMP4B filaments can promote or stabilize negative curvature and outward budding. CHMP4A/B/C are required for the exosomal release of SDCBP, CD63 and syndecan. Majority of the protein exists in a folded closed conformation (By similarity)"

In contrast to most receptor tyrosine kinases, RET requires not only its cognate ligands but also coreceptors, for activation. GDNF ligands (GDNF, NRTN, ARTN, PSPN and GDF15) first bind their corresponding GDNFR coreceptors (GFRA1, GFRA2, GFRA3, GFRA4 and GFRAL, respectively), triggering RET autophosphorylation and activation, leading to activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the MAPK- and AKT-signaling pathways. Acts as a dependence receptor via the GDNF-GFRA1 signaling: in the presence of the ligand GDNF in somatotrophs within pituitary, promotes survival and down regulates growth hormone (GH) production, but triggers apoptosis in absence of GDNF. Required for the molecular mechanisms orchestration during intestine organogenesis via the ARTN-GFRA3 signaling: involved in the development of enteric nervous system and renal organogenesis during embryonic life, and promotes the formation of Peyer's patch-like structures, a major component of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue.

    "description": "Catalyzes the hydroxylation of the 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-polyprenyl)benzoquinone at the C6 position and participates in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone. Catalyzes the reaction through a substrate-mediated reduction pathway, whereby NADH shuttles electrons to 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-decaprenyl)benzoquinone, which then transfers the electrons to the two Fe(3+) centers. The binding of 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-polyprenyl)benzoquinone (DMQn) mediates reduction of the diiron center by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and initiates oxygen activation for subsequent DMQ hydroxylation. The physiological substrates are 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-nonaprenyl)benzoquinone (DMQ(9)) and 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-decaprenyl)benzoquinone (DMQ(10)), however in vitro the enzyme does not have any specificity concerning the length of the polyprenyl tail, and accepts tails of various lengths with similar efficiency (By similarity). Also has a structural role in the COQ enzyme complex, stabilizing other COQ polypeptides (By similarity). Involved in lifespan determination in a ubiquinone-independent manner (PubMed:19478076). Plays a role in modulating mitochondrial stress responses, acting in the nucleus, perhaps via regulating gene expression, independent of its characterized mitochondrial function in ubiquinone biosynthesis (By similarity)"

    "description": "Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme essential for the replication of chromosome termini in most eukaryotes. Active in progenitor and cancer cells. Inactive, or very low activity, in normal somatic cells. Catalytic component of the teleromerase holoenzyme complex whose main activity is the elongation of telomeres by acting as a reverse transcriptase that adds simple sequence repeats to chromosome ends by copying a template sequence within the RNA component of the enzyme. Catalyzes the RNA-dependent extension of 3'-chromosomal termini with the 6-nucleotide telomeric repeat unit, 5'-TTAGGG-3'. The catalytic cycle involves primer binding, primer extension and release of product once the template boundary has been reached or nascent product translocation followed by further extension. More active on substrates containing 2 or 3 telomeric repeats. Telomerase activity is regulated by a number of factors including telomerase complex-associated proteins, chaperones and polypeptide modifiers. Modulates Wnt signaling. Plays important roles in aging and antiapoptosis (By similarity)"

Reports on stimulating functions suggest that the activity may be influenced by the cellular context and/or the respective ligand. Regulates macrophage activation. Inhibits T-helper type 1 lymphocyte (Th1)-mediated auto- and alloimmune responses and promotes immunological tolerance. In CD8+ cells attenuates TCR-induced signaling, specifically by blocking NF-kappaB and NFAT promoter activities resulting in the loss of IL-2 secretion. The function may implicate its association with LCK proposed to impair phosphorylation of TCR subunits. In contrast, shown to activate TCR-induced signaling in T-cells probably implicating ZAP70, LCP2, LCK and FYN. Expressed on Treg cells can inhibit Th17 cell responses. Receptor for LGALS9. Binding to LGALS9 is believed to result in suppression of T-cell responses; the resulting apoptosis of antigen-specific cells may implicate HAVCR2 phosphorylation and disruption of its association with BAG6. Binding to LGALS9 is proposed to be involved in innate immune response to intracellular pathogens. Expressed on Th1 cells interacts with LGALS9 expressed on Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected macrophages to stimulate antibactericidal activity including IL-1 beta secretion and to restrict intracellular bacterial growth. However, the function as receptor for LGALS9 has been challenged (By similarity). Also reported to enhance CD8+ T cell responses to an acute infection such as by Listeria monocytogenes. Receptor for phosphatidylserine (PtSer); PtSer-binding is calcium-dependent. May recognize PtSer on apoptotic cells leading to their phagocytosis. Mediates the engulfment of apoptotic cells by dendritic cells. Expressed on T-cells, promotes conjugation but not engulfment of apoptotic cells. Expressed on dendritic cells (DCs) positively regulates innate immune response and in synergy with Toll-like receptors promotes secretion of TNF-alpha. In tumor-imfiltrating DCs suppresses nucleic acid-mediated innate immune repsonse by interaction with HMGB1 and interfering with nucleic acid-sensing and trafficking of nucleid acids to endosomes. Can enhance mast cell production of Th2 cytokines Il-4, IL-6 and IL-13. Expressed on natural killer (NK) cells acts as a coreceptor to enhance IFN-gamma production in response to LGALS9. In contrast, shown to suppress NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Negatively regulates NK cell function in LPS-induced endotoxic shock"

Precursor of botulinum neurotoxin A which has 2 coreceptors; complex polysialylated gangliosides found on neural tissue and specific membrane-anchored proteins of synaptic vesicles. Receptor proteins are exposed on host presynaptic cell membrane during neurotransmitter release, when the toxin heavy chain (HC) binds to them. Upon synaptic vesicle recycling the toxin is taken up via the endocytic pathway. When the pH of the toxin-containing endosome drops a structural rearrangement occurs so that the N-terminus of the HC forms pores that allows the light chain (LC) to translocate into the cytosol (PubMed:17666397, PubMed:19096517). Once in the cytosol the disulfide bond linking the 2 subunits is reduced and LC cleaves its target protein on synaptic vesicles, preventing their fusion with the cytoplasmic membrane and thus neurotransmitter release. Toxin activity requires polysialylated gangliosides; GT1b supports activity better than GD1a (PubMed:12089155). Binds to host peripheral neuronal presynaptic membranes via the synaptic vesicle glycoproteins SV2A, SV2B and SV2C (PubMed:16543415). It binds directly to the largest lumenal (intravesicular) loop of SV2A, SV2B and SV2C that is transiently exposed outside of cells during exocytosis; gangliosides enhance binding (PubMed:16543415, PubMed:16545378, PubMed:18815274). Recognizes an N-linked glycan on SV2 proteins (PubMed:18815274, PubMed:27294781). May also use FGFR3 as a receptor (PubMed:23696738). Toxin uptake into neural cells requires stimulation (incubation with K(+) to stimulate receptor exposure) to be internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis (PubMed:16543415, PubMed:19650874, PubMed:21632541, PubMed:21832053). Subsequently the toxin colocalizes with its receptor in host cells (PubMed:16543415, PubMed:19650874).

Has a strong preference for DNA that has been recently acquired by horizontal gene transfer, binding strongly to Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (SPI1 and SPI2); this offers the selective advantage of silencing foreign DNA while keeping it in the genome in case of need (PubMed:16933988, PubMed:21059643).

It plays a role in the thermal control of pili production (By similarity). It is subject to transcriptional auto-repression (By similarity).

Plays a pivotal role in the protein quality control system, ensuring the correct folding of proteins, the re-folding of misfolded proteins and controlling the targeting of proteins for subsequent degradation. This is achieved through cycles of ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis and ADP release, mediated by co-chaperones. The co-chaperones have been shown to not only regulate different steps of the ATPase cycle, but they also have an individual specificity such that one co-chaperone may promote folding of a substrate while another may promote degradation. The affinity for polypeptides is regulated by its nucleotide bound state. In the ATP-bound form, it has a low affinity for substrate proteins. However, upon hydrolysis of the ATP to ADP, it undergoes a conformational change that increases its affinity for substrate proteins. It goes through repeated cycles of ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange, which permits cycles of substrate binding and release. The co-chaperones are of three types: J-domain co-chaperones such as HSP40s (stimulate ATPase hydrolysis by HSP70), the nucleotide exchange factors (NEF) such as BAG1/2/3 (facilitate conversion of HSP70 from the ADP-bound to the ATP-bound state thereby promoting substrate release), and the TPR domain chaperones such as HOPX and STUB1. Maintains protein homeostasis during cellular stress through two opposing mechanisms: protein refolding and degradation. Its acetylation/deacetylation state determines whether it functions in protein refolding or protein degradation by controlling the competitive binding of co-chaperones HOPX and STUB1. During the early stress response, the acetylated form binds to HOPX which assists in chaperone-mediated protein refolding, thereafter, it is deacetylated and binds to ubiquitin ligase STUB1 that promotes ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. Regulates centrosome integrity during mitosis, and is required for the maintenance of a functional mitotic centrosome that supports the assembly of a bipolar mitotic spindle. Enhances STUB1-mediated SMAD3 ubiquitination and degradation and facilitates STUB1-mediated inhibition of TGF-beta signaling. Essential for STUB1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of FOXP3 in regulatory T-cells (Treg) during inflammation. Required as a co-chaperone for optimal STUB1/CHIP ubiquitination of NFATC3 (By similarity). Negatively regulates heat shock-induced HSF1 transcriptional activity during the attenuation and recovery phase period of the heat shock response"

Secreted immunoglobulins mediate the effector phase of humoral immunity, which results in the elimination of bound antigens (PubMed:20176268, PubMed:22158414). The antigen binding site is formed by the variable domain of one heavy chain, together with that of its associated light chain. Thus, each immunoglobulin has two antigen binding sites with remarkable affinity for a particular antigen. The variable domains are assembled by a process called V-(D)-J rearrangement and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen (PubMed:17576170, PubMed:20176268)"

Core component of the splicing-dependent multiprotein exon junction complex (EJC) deposited at splice junctions on mRNAs. The EJC is a dynamic structure consisting of core proteins and several peripheral nuclear and cytoplasmic associated factors that join the complex only transiently either during EJC assembly or during subsequent mRNA metabolism. The EJC marks the position of the exon-exon junction in the mature mRNA for the gene expression machinery and the core components remain bound to spliced mRNAs throughout all stages of mRNA metabolism thereby influencing downstream processes including nuclear mRNA export, subcellular mRNA localization, translation efficiency and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Its RNA-dependent ATPase and RNA-helicase activities are induced by CASC3, but abolished in presence of the MAGOH-RBM8A heterodimer, thereby trapping the ATP-bound EJC core onto spliced mRNA in a stable conformation. The inhibition of ATPase activity by the MAGOH-RBM8A heterodimer increases the RNA-binding affinity of the EJC. Involved in translational enhancement of spliced mRNAs after formation of the 80S ribosome complex.

    "description": "Probable protease subunit of the COP9 signalosome complex (CSN), a complex involved in various cellular and developmental processes. The CSN complex is an essential regulator of the ubiquitin (Ubl) conjugation pathway by mediating the deneddylation of the cullin subunits of the SCF-type E3 ligase complexes, leading to decrease the Ubl ligase activity of SCF-type complexes such as SCF, CSA or DDB2. Promotes the proteasomal degradation of BRSK2. The complex is also involved in phosphorylation of p53/TP53, c-jun/JUN, IkappaBalpha/NFKBIA, ITPK1 and IRF8, possibly via its association with CK2 and PKD kinases. CSN-dependent phosphorylation of TP53 and JUN promotes and protects degradation by the Ubl system, respectively. In the complex, it probably acts as the catalytic center that mediates the cleavage of Nedd8 from cullins. It however has no metalloprotease activity by itself and requires the other subunits of the CSN complex. Interacts directly with a large number of proteins that are regulated by the CSN complex, confirming a key role in the complex"

Acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological circumstances and cell type (PubMed:11025664, PubMed:12524540, PubMed:12810724, PubMed:15186775, PubMed:15340061, PubMed:17189187, PubMed:17317671, PubMed:17349958, PubMed:19556538, PubMed:20673990, PubMed:20959462, PubMed:22726440, PubMed:24051492, PubMed:24652652, PubMed:38653238, PubMed:9840937). Negatively regulates cell division by controlling expression of a set of genes required for this process (PubMed:11025664, PubMed:12524540, PubMed:12810724, PubMed:15186775, PubMed:15340061, PubMed:17317671, PubMed:17349958, PubMed:19556538, PubMed:20673990, PubMed:20959462, PubMed:22726440, PubMed:24051492, PubMed:24652652, PubMed:9840937). One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression (PubMed:12524540, PubMed:17189187). Its pro-apoptotic activity is activated via its interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 (PubMed:12524540). However, this activity is inhibited when the interaction with PPP1R13B/ASPP1 or TP53BP2/ASPP2 is displaced by PPP1R13L/iASPP (PubMed:12524540). In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA-Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seems to have an effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492)"

L-glutamate acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter at many synapses in the central nervous system. Binding of the excitatory neurotransmitter L-glutamate induces a conformation change, leading to the opening of the cation channel, and thereby converts the chemical signal to an electrical impulse upon entry of monovalent and divalent cations such as sodium and calcium. The receptor then desensitizes rapidly and enters in a transient inactive state, characterized by the presence of bound agonist. In the presence of CACNG2 or CACNG4 or CACNG7 or CACNG8, shows resensitization which is characterized by a delayed accumulation of current flux upon continued application of L-glutamate. Calcium (Ca(2+)) permeability depends on subunits composition and, heteromeric channels containing edited GRIA2 subunit are calcium-impermeable. Also permeable to other divalents cations such as strontium(2+) and magnesium(2+) and monovalent cations such as potassium(1+) and lithium(1+) (By similarity)"

The proposed role as modulator of nAChR activity seems to be dependent on the nAChR subtype and stoichiometry, and to involve an effect on nAChR trafficking and its cell surface expression, and on single channel properties of the nAChR inserted in the plasma membrane. Modulates functional properties of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) to prevent excessive excitation, and hence neurodegeneration. Enhances desensitization by increasing both the rate and extent of desensitization of alpha-4:beta-2-containing nAChRs and slowing recovery from desensitization. Promotes large amplitude ACh-evoked currents through alpha-4:beta-2 nAChRs (PubMed:10402197, PubMed:11906696). Is involved in regulation of the nAChR pentameric assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum. Shifts stoichiometry from high sensitivity alpha-4(2):beta-2(3) to low sensitivity alpha-4(3):beta-2(2) nAChR (PubMed:25193667). In vitro modulates alpha-3:beta-4-containing nAChRs. Reduces cell surface expression of (alpha-3:beta-4)(2):beta-4 and (alpha-3:beta-4)(2):alpha-5 nAChRs suggesting an interaction with nAChR alpha-3(-):(+)beta-4 subunit interfaces and an allosteric mode. Corresponding single channel effects characterized by decreased unitary conductance, altered burst proportions and enhanced desensitization/inactivation seem to depend on nAChR alpha:alpha subunit interfaces and are greater in (alpha-3:beta-2)(2):alpha-3 when compared to (alpha-3:beta-2)(2):alpha-5 nAChRs (By similarity).

The antigen binding site is formed by the variable domain of one heavy chain, together with that of its associated light chain. Thus, each immunoglobulin has two antigen binding sites with remarkable affinity for a particular antigen. The variable domains are assembled by a process called V-(D)-J rearrangement and can then be subjected to somatic hypermutations which, after exposure to antigen and selection, allow affinity maturation for a particular antigen (PubMed:17576170, PubMed:20176268).

MAPK12 is one of the four p38 MAPKs which play an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress leading to direct activation of transcription factors such as ELK1 and ATF2. Accordingly, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate a broad range of proteins and it has been estimated that they may have approximately 200 to 300 substrates each. Some of the targets are downstream kinases such as MAPKAPK2, which are activated through phosphorylation and further phosphorylate additional targets. Plays a role in myoblast differentiation and also in the down-regulation of cyclin D1 in response to hypoxia in adrenal cells suggesting MAPK12 may inhibit cell proliferation while promoting differentiation. Phosphorylates DLG1. Following osmotic shock, MAPK12 in the cell nucleus increases its association with nuclear DLG1, thereby causing dissociation of DLG1-SFPQ complexes. This function is independent of its catalytic activity and could affect mRNA processing and/or gene transcription to aid cell adaptation to osmolarity changes in the environment. Regulates UV-induced checkpoint signaling and repair of UV-induced DNA damage and G2 arrest after gamma-radiation exposure. MAPK12 is involved in the regulation of SLC2A1 expression and basal glucose uptake in L6 myotubes; and negatively regulates SLC2A4 expression and contraction-mediated glucose uptake in adult skeletal muscle. C-Jun (JUN) phosphorylation is stimulated by MAPK14 and inhibited by MAPK12, leading to a distinct AP-1 regulation. MAPK12 is required for the normal kinetochore localization of PLK1, prevents chromosomal instability and supports mitotic cell viability. MAPK12-signaling is also positively regulating the expansion of transient amplifying myogenic precursor cells during muscle growth and regeneration"

    "description": "AKT1 is one of 3 closely related serine/threonine-protein kinases (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3) called the AKT kinase, and which regulate many processes including metabolism, proliferation, cell survival, growth and angiogenesis (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:21954288, PubMed:26095253, PubMed:26107252, PubMed:30504268, PubMed:32350463). This is mediated through serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates. Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:21954288, PubMed:23684622, PubMed:26235620). AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface (PubMed:9415393). Phosphorylation of PTPN1 at 'Ser-50' negatively modulates its phosphatase activity preventing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the attenuation of insulin signaling (PubMed:11579209). Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 triggers the binding of this effector to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins, which is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport (PubMed:11994271). AKT also regulates the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen by phosphorylating GSK3A at 'Ser-21' and GSK3B at 'Ser-9', resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity (PubMed:22057101). Phosphorylation of GSK3 isoforms by AKT is also thought to be one mechanism by which cell proliferation is driven (PubMed:22057101). AKT also regulates cell survival via the phosphorylation of MAP3K5 (apoptosis signal-related kinase). Phosphorylation of 'Ser-83' decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity stimulated by oxidative stress and thereby prevents apoptosis. AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 at 'Ser-939' and 'Thr-1462', thereby activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway, and leading to both phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and in activation of RPS6KB1. Also regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway by catalyzing phosphorylation of CASTOR1 and DEPDC5. AKT plays a role as key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation (PubMed:19778506). Part of a positive feedback loop of mTORC2 signaling by mediating phosphorylation of MAPKAP1/SIN1, promoting mTORC2 activation (PubMed:23684622, PubMed:26235620). AKT is involved in the phosphorylation of members of the FOXO factors (Forkhead family of transcription factors), leading to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic localization. In particular, FOXO1 is phosphorylated at 'Thr-24', 'Ser-256' and 'Ser-319'. FOXO3 and FOXO4 are phosphorylated on equivalent sites. AKT has an important role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription and positively regulates the activity of CREB1 (cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein). The phosphorylation of CREB1 induces the binding of accessory proteins that are necessary for the transcription of pro-survival genes such as BCL2 and MCL1 (By similarity). AKT phosphorylates 'Ser-454' on ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby potentially regulating ACLY activity and fatty acid synthesis (By similarity). Activates the 3B isoform of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) via phosphorylation of 'Ser-273', resulting in reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibition of lipolysis (PubMed:10454575). Phosphorylates PIKFYVE on 'Ser-318', which results in increased PI(3)P-5 activity (By similarity). The Rho GTPase-activating protein DLC1 is another substrate and its phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation cell proliferation and cell growth (By similarity). Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) to mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) (PubMed:11282895, PubMed:18288188). AKT mediates the antiapoptotic effects of IGF1 (PubMed:11282895). Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly (By similarity). May be involved in the regulation of the placental development (PubMed:12783884). Phosphorylates STK4/MST1 at 'Thr-120' and 'Thr-387' leading to inhibition of its: kinase activity, nuclear translocation, autophosphorylation and ability to phosphorylate FOXO3. Phosphorylates STK3/MST2 at 'Thr-117' and 'Thr-384' leading to inhibition of its: cleavage, kinase activity, autophosphorylation at Thr-180, binding to RASSF1 and nuclear translocation. Phosphorylates SRPK2 and enhances its kinase activity towards SRSF2 and ACIN1 and promotes its nuclear translocation. Phosphorylates RAF1 at 'Ser-259' and negatively regulates its activity. Phosphorylation of BAD stimulates its pro-apoptotic activity. Phosphorylates KAT6A at 'Thr-369' and this phosphorylation inhibits the interaction of KAT6A with PML and negatively regulates its acetylation activity towards p53/TP53. Phosphorylates palladin (PALLD), modulating cytoskeletal organization and cell motility. Phosphorylates prohibitin (PHB), playing an important role in cell metabolism and proliferation. Phosphorylates CDKN1A, for which phosphorylation at 'Thr-145' induces its release from CDK2 and cytoplasmic relocalization. These recent findings indicate that the AKT1 isoform has a more specific role in cell motility and proliferation. Phosphorylates CLK2 thereby controlling cell survival to ionizing radiation (By similarity). Phosphorylates PCK1 at 'Ser-90', reducing the binding affinity of PCK1 to oxaloacetate and changing PCK1 into an atypical protein kinase activity using GTP as donor (By similarity). Also acts as an activator of TMEM175 potassium channel activity in response to growth factors: forms the lysoK(GF) complex together with TMEM175 and acts by promoting TMEM175 channel activation, independently of its protein kinase activity (PubMed:32228865). Acts as a negative regulator of the cGAS-STING pathway by mediating phosphorylation of CGAS during mitosis, leading to its inhibition (PubMed:26440888). Acts as a regulator of mitochondrial calcium uptake by mediating phosphorylation of MICU1 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, impairing MICU1 maturation (PubMed:30504268). Acts as an inhibitor of tRNA methylation by mediating phosphorylation of the N-terminus of METTL1, thereby inhibiting METTL1 methyltransferase activity (By similarity). In response to LPAR1 receptor pathway activation, phosphorylates Rabin8/RAB3IP which alters its activity and phosphorylates WDR44 which induces WDR44 binding to Rab11, thereby switching Rab11 vesicular function from preciliary trafficking to endocytic recycling (By similarity)"

Required for normal embryonic patterning, trophoblast function, limb bud development, lung morphogenesis, osteogenesis and skin development. Plays an essential role in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, and is required for normal skeleton development. Promotes cell proliferation in keratinocytes and immature osteoblasts, but promotes apoptosis in differentiated osteoblasts. Phosphorylates PLCG1, FRS2 and PAK4. Ligand binding leads to the activation of several signaling cascades. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Phosphorylation of FRS2 triggers recruitment of GRB2, GAB1, PIK3R1 and SOS1, and mediates activation of RAS, MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as well as of the AKT1 signaling pathway. FGFR2 signaling is down-regulated by ubiquitination, internalization and degradation. Mutations that lead to constitutive kinase activation or impair normal FGFR2 maturation, internalization and degradation lead to aberrant signaling. Over-expressed FGFR2 promotes activation of STAT1"

Perceives low blue light (LBL) and responds by directly contacting two bHLH transcription factors, PIF4 and PIF5, at chromatin on E-box variant 5'-CA[CT]GTG-3' to promote their activity and stimulate specific gene expression to adapt global physiology (e.g. hypocotyl elongation and hyponastic growth in low blue light) (PubMed:19558423, PubMed:26724867). When activated by high-intensity blue light, catalyzes direct enzymatic conversion of molecular oxygen O(2) to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hydrogen peroxide H(2)O(2) in vitro. ROS accumulation upon activation by blue light leads to cell death in protoplasts (PubMed:25728686). Seems essential for blue-light-triggered and singlet oxygen-mediated programmed cell death (PCD) (PubMed:17075038). Required for the induction of nuclear genes encoding photoprotective components by GATA24 and GATA28 in extreme light intensities that exceed the electron utilization capacity of the chloroplast (PubMed:22786870). Involved in shortening the circadian clock period, especially at 27 degrees Celsius, in blue light (BL) and required to maintain clock genes expression rhythm (PubMed:23511208). Mediates blue light-induced gene expression and hypocotyl elongation through the inhibition of COP1-mediated degradation of the transcription factors BIT1 and HY5 and via the activation of anion channels at the plasma membrane, probably via auxin signaling (PubMed:12324610, PubMed:16093319, PubMed:18397371, PubMed:21511871, PubMed:21511872, PubMed:25721730, PubMed:8528277, PubMed:9765547). Required for the hypocotyl hook formation in darkness (PubMed:22855128). Involved in blue light-dependent stomatal opening, CHS gene expression, transpiration, inhibition of stem growth and increase of root growth, probably by regulating abscisic acid (ABA) (PubMed:16093319, PubMed:16703358, PubMed:22147516, PubMed:7756321, PubMed:9565033). Prevents lateral roots growth by inhibiting auxin transport (PubMed:20133010). Necessary for shade avoidance syndrome (SAS), characterized by leaf hyponasty and reduced lamina/petiole ratio, when exposed to blue light attenuation (PubMed:21457375). Together with phototropins, involved in phototropism regulation by various blue light fluence; blue light attenuates phototropism in high fluence rates (100 umol.m-2.s-1) but enhances phototropism in low fluence rates (<1.0 umol.m-2.s-1) (PubMed:12857830). Required for blue/UV-A wavelengths-mediated inhibition of explants shoot regeneration in vitro (e.g. new shoot apical meristems regeneration from excised cotyledons) (PubMed:22681544). Modulates anthocyanin accumulation in a PHYA-dependent manner in far-red-light. Acts as a PHYA/PHYB-dependent modulator of chlorophyll accumulation in red light. Contributes to most blue light deetiolation responses (PubMed:8528277, PubMed:9733523). May act as a chemical magnetoreceptor, via magnetically sensitive kinetics and quantum yields of photo-induced flavin / tryptophan radical pairs (PubMed:22421133). The effect of near-null magnetic field on flowering is altered by changes of blue light cycle and intensity in a CRY1/CRY2-dependent manner (PubMed:26095447). Involved in the strigolactone signaling that regulates hypocotyl growth in response to blue light (PubMed:24126495). Modulates temperature-dependent growth and physiology maintenance, especially at warm ambient temperatures (e.g. 27 degrees Celsius) and in white light and low-light conditions, via HFR1-dependent activity; this process requires PTAC12/HMR/PAP5 (transcriptional transactivator) (PubMed:21265897, PubMed:30635559)"

Functions either as activator or repressor modulating the rate of target gene transcription through RNA polymerase II enzyme in a promoter-dependent manner. Binds to the consensus octamer motif 5'-AT[A/T]A[T/A]T[A/T]A-3' of promoter of target genes. Plays a fundamental role in the gene regulatory network essential for retinal ganglion cell (RGC) differentiation. Binds to an octamer site to form a ternary complex with ISL1; cooperates positively with ISL1 and ISL2 to potentiate transcriptional activation of RGC target genes being involved in RGC fate commitment in the developing retina and RGC axon formation and pathfinding. Inhibits DLX1 and DLX2 transcriptional activities preventing DLX1- and DLX2-mediated ability to promote amacrine cell fate specification. In cooperation with TP53 potentiates transcriptional activation of BAX promoter activity increasing neuronal cell apoptosis. Negatively regulates BAX promoter activity in the absence of TP53. Acts as a transcriptional coactivator via its interaction with the transcription factor ESR1 by enhancing its effect on estrogen response element (ERE)-containing promoter. Antagonizes the transcriptional stimulatory activity of POU4F1 by preventing its binding to an octamer motif. Involved in TNFSF11-mediated terminal osteoclast differentiation"

The functional specificity of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex depends on the variable substrate recognition component. DCX(DET1-COP1) directs ubiquitination of JUN. DCX(DDB2) directs ubiquitination of XPC. DCX(DDB2) ubiquitinates histones H3-H4 and is required for efficient histone deposition during replication-coupled (H3.1) and replication-independent (H3.3) nucleosome assembly, probably by facilitating the transfer of H3 from ASF1A/ASF1B to other chaperones involved in histone deposition.

With CUL4B, contributes to ribosome biogenesis. The DCX(AMBRA1) complex is a master regulator of the transition from G1 to S cell phase by mediating ubiquitination of phosphorylated cyclin-D (CCND1, CCND2 and CCND3).

The EJC marks the position of the exon-exon junction in the mature mRNA for the gene expression machinery and the core components remain bound to spliced mRNAs throughout all stages of mRNA metabolism thereby influencing downstream processes including nuclear mRNA export, subcellular mRNA localization, translation efficiency and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). The MAGOH-RBM8A heterodimer inhibits the ATPase activity of EIF4A3, thereby trapping the ATP-bound EJC core onto spliced mRNA in a stable conformation. The MAGOH-RBM8A heterodimer interacts with the EJC key regulator PYM1 leading to EJC disassembly in the cytoplasm and translation enhancement of EJC-bearing spliced mRNAs by recruiting them to the ribosomal 48S pre-initiation complex. Involved in the splicing modulation of BCL2L1/Bcl-X (and probably other apoptotic genes); specifically inhibits formation of proapoptotic isoforms such as Bcl-X(S); the function is different from the established EJC assembly"

Involved in cell proliferation and cell growth arrest by positive and negative regulation of the cell cycle. Can promote cell growth by phosphorylating and activating RAF1, which mediates the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade, and/or by up-regulating CDKN1A, which facilitates active cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex formation in glioma cells. In intestinal cells stimulated by the phorbol ester PMA, can trigger a cell cycle arrest program which is associated with the accumulation of the hyper-phosphorylated growth-suppressive form of RB1 and induction of the CDK inhibitors CDKN1A and CDKN1B. Exhibits anti-apoptotic function in glioma cells and protects them from apoptosis by suppressing the p53/TP53-mediated activation of IGFBP3, and in leukemia cells mediates anti-apoptotic action by phosphorylating BCL2. During macrophage differentiation induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1), is translocated to the nucleus and is associated with macrophage development. After wounding, translocates from focal contacts to lamellipodia and participates in the modulation of desmosomal adhesion. Plays a role in cell motility by phosphorylating CSPG4, which induces association of CSPG4 with extensive lamellipodia at the cell periphery and polarization of the cell accompanied by increases in cell motility. During chemokine-induced CD4(+) T cell migration, phosphorylates CDC42-guanine exchange factor DOCK8 resulting in its dissociation from LRCH1 and the activation of GTPase CDC42 (PubMed:28028151). Is highly expressed in a number of cancer cells where it can act as a tumor promoter and is implicated in malignant phenotypes of several tumors such as gliomas and breast cancers. Negatively regulates myocardial contractility and positively regulates angiogenesis, platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in arteries. Mediates hypertrophic growth of neonatal cardiomyocytes, in part through a MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2)-dependent signaling pathway, and upon PMA treatment, is required to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy up to heart failure and death, by increasing protein synthesis, protein-DNA ratio and cell surface area. Regulates cardiomyocyte function by phosphorylating cardiac troponin T (TNNT2/CTNT), which induces significant reduction in actomyosin ATPase activity, myofilament calcium sensitivity and myocardial contractility. In angiogenesis, is required for full endothelial cell migration, adhesion to vitronectin (VTN), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA)-dependent regulation of kinase activation and vascular tube formation. Involved in the stabilization of VEGFA mRNA at post-transcriptional level and mediates VEGFA-induced cell proliferation. In the regulation of calcium-induced platelet aggregation, mediates signals from the CD36/GP4 receptor for granule release, and activates the integrin heterodimer ITGA2B-ITGB3 through the RAP1GAP pathway for adhesion. During response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS), may regulate selective LPS-induced macrophage functions involved in host defense and inflammation. But in some inflammatory responses, may negatively regulate NF-kappa-B-induced genes, through IL1A-dependent induction of NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha (NFKBIA/IKBA). Upon stimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), phosphorylates EIF4G1, which modulates EIF4G1 binding to MKNK1 and may be involved in the regulation of EIF4E phosphorylation. Phosphorylates KIT, leading to inhibition of KIT activity. Phosphorylates ATF2 which promotes cooperation between ATF2 and JUN, activating transcription. Phosphorylates SOCS2 at 'Ser-52' facilitating its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (By similarity). Phosphorylates KLHL3 in response to angiotensin II signaling, decreasing the interaction between KLHL3 and WNK4 (PubMed:25313067).

Acts as a key immune sensor by catalyzing ubiquitination of the lipid A moiety of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via its RZ-type zinc-finger: restricts the proliferation of cytosolic bacteria, such as Salmonella, by generating the bacterial ubiquitin coat through the ubiquitination of LPS (PubMed:34012115). Also acts indirectly by mediating the recruitment of the LUBAC complex, which conjugates linear polyubiquitin chains (By similarity). Ubiquitination of LPS triggers cell-autonomous immunity, such as antibacterial autophagy, leading to degradation of the microbial invader (By similarity). Involved in lipid metabolism by regulating fat storage and lipid droplet formation; act by inhibiting the lipolytic process (By similarity). Also regulates lipotoxicity by inhibiting desaturation of fatty acids (By similarity). Also acts as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase via its RING-type zinc finger: mediates 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of target proteins (By similarity). Involved in the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway in vascular development: acts by mediating ubiquitination and degradation of FLNA and NFATC2 downstream of RSPO3, leading to inhibit the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway and promoting vessel regression (By similarity). Also has ATPase activity; ATPase activity is required for ubiquitination of LPS (PubMed:32573437)"

Pol II-mediated transcription cycle proceeds through transcription initiation, transcription elongation and transcription termination stages. During transcription initiation, Pol II pre-initiation complex (PIC) is recruited to DNA promoters, with focused-type promoters containing either the initiator (Inr) element, or the TATA-box found in cell-type specific genes and dispersed-type promoters that often contain hypomethylated CpG islands usually found in housekeeping genes. Once the polymerase has escaped from the promoter it enters the elongation phase during which RNA is actively polymerized, based on complementarity with the template DNA strand. Transcription termination involves the release of the RNA transcript and polymerase from the DNA (By similarity) (PubMed:18252004, PubMed:24207025). Forms Pol II active center together with the second largest subunit POLR2B/RPB2. Appends one nucleotide at a time to the 3' end of the nascent RNA, with POLR2A/RPB1 most likely contributing a Mg(2+)-coordinating DxDGD motif, and POLR2B/RPB2 participating in the coordination of a second Mg(2+) ion and providing lysine residues believed to facilitate Watson-Crick base pairing between the incoming nucleotide and template base. Typically, Mg(2+) ions direct a 5' nucleoside triphosphate to form a phosphodiester bond with the 3' hydroxyl of the preceding nucleotide of the nascent RNA, with the elimination of pyrophosphate. The reversible pyrophosphorolysis can occur at high pyrophosphate concentrations (By similarity). Can proofread the nascent RNA transcript by means of a 3' -> 5' exonuclease activity. If a ribonucleotide is mis-incorporated, backtracks along the template DNA and cleaves the phosphodiester bond releasing the mis-incorporated 5'-ribonucleotide (By similarity). Through its unique C-terminal domain (CTD, 52 heptapeptide tandem repeats) serves as a platform for assembly of factors that regulate transcription initiation, elongation and termination. CTD phosphorylation on Ser-5 mediates Pol II promoter escape, whereas phosphorylation on Ser-2 is required for Pol II pause release during transcription elongation and further pre-mRNA processing. Additionally, the regulation of gene expression levels depends on the balance between methylation and acetylation levels of the CTD-lysines. Initiation or early elongation steps of transcription of growth-factor-induced immediate early genes are regulated by the acetylation status of the CTD. Methylation and dimethylation have a repressive effect on target genes expression. Cooperates with mRNA splicing machinery in co-transcriptional 5'-end capping and co-transcriptional splicing of pre-mRNA (By similarity) (PubMed:24207025, PubMed:26687004)"

When covalently bound, it is conjugated to target proteins via an isopeptide bond either as a monomer (monoubiquitin), a polymer linked via different Lys residues of the ubiquitin (polyubiquitin chains) or a linear polymer linked via the initiator Met of the ubiquitin (linear polyubiquitin chains). Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-6-linked may be involved in DNA repair; Lys-11-linked is involved in ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation) and in cell-cycle regulation; Lys-29-linked is involved in proteotoxic stress response and cell cycle; Lys-33-linked is involved in kinase modification; Lys-48-linked is involved in protein degradation via the proteasome; Lys-63-linked is involved in endocytosis, DNA-damage responses as well as in signaling processes leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B. Linear polymer chains formed via attachment by the initiator Met lead to cell signaling. Ubiquitin is usually conjugated to Lys residues of target proteins, however, in rare cases, conjugation to Cys or Ser residues has been observed. When polyubiquitin is free (unanchored-polyubiquitin), it also has distinct roles, such as in activation of protein kinases, and in signaling"

    "description": "NAD-dependent protein deacetylase that links transcriptional regulation directly to intracellular energetics and participates in the coordination of several separated cellular functions such as cell cycle, response to DNA damage, metabolism, apoptosis and autophagy. Can modulate chromatin function through deacetylation of histones and can promote alterations in the methylation of histones and DNA, leading to transcriptional repression. Deacetylates a broad range of transcription factors and coregulators, thereby regulating target gene expression positively and negatively. Serves as a sensor of the cytosolic ratio of NAD(+)/NADH which is altered by glucose deprivation and metabolic changes associated with caloric restriction. Is essential in skeletal muscle cell differentiation and in response to low nutrients mediates the inhibitory effect on skeletal myoblast differentiation which also involves 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). Component of the eNoSC (energy-dependent nucleolar silencing) complex, a complex that mediates silencing of rDNA in response to intracellular energy status and acts by recruiting histone-modifying enzymes. The eNoSC complex is able to sense the energy status of cell: upon glucose starvation, elevation of NAD(+)/NADP(+) ratio activates SIRT1, leading to histone H3 deacetylation followed by dimethylation of H3 at 'Lys-9' (H3K9me2) by SUV39H1 and the formation of silent chromatin in the rDNA locus. Deacetylates 'Lys-266' of SUV39H1, leading to its activation. Inhibits skeletal muscle differentiation by deacetylating PCAF and MYOD1. Deacetylates H2A and 'Lys-26' of H1-4. Deacetylates 'Lys-16' of histone H4 (in vitro). Involved in NR0B2/SHP corepression function through chromatin remodeling: Recruited to LRH1 target gene promoters by NR0B2/SHP thereby stimulating histone H3 and H4 deacetylation leading to transcriptional repression. Proposed to contribute to genomic integrity via positive regulation of telomere length; however, reports on localization to pericentromeric heterochromatin are conflicting. Proposed to play a role in constitutive heterochromatin (CH) formation and/or maintenance through regulation of the available pool of nuclear SUV39H1. Upon oxidative/metabolic stress decreases SUV39H1 degradation by inhibiting SUV39H1 polyubiquitination by MDM2. This increase in SUV39H1 levels enhances SUV39H1 turnover in CH, which in turn seems to accelerate renewal of the heterochromatin which correlates with greater genomic integrity during stress response. Deacetylates 'Lys-382' of p53/TP53 and impairs its ability to induce transcription-dependent proapoptotic program and modulate cell senescence. Deacetylates TAF1B and thereby represses rDNA transcription by the RNA polymerase I. Deacetylates MYC, promotes the association of MYC with MAX and decreases MYC stability leading to compromised transformational capability. Deacetylates FOXO3 in response to oxidative stress thereby increasing its ability to induce cell cycle arrest and resistance to oxidative stress but inhibiting FOXO3-mediated induction of apoptosis transcriptional activity; also leading to FOXO3 ubiquitination and protesomal degradation. Appears to have a similar effect on MLLT7/FOXO4 in regulation of transcriptional activity and apoptosis. Deacetylates DNMT1; thereby impairs DNMT1 methyltransferase-independent transcription repressor activity, modulates DNMT1 cell cycle regulatory function and DNMT1-mediated gene silencing. Deacetylates RELA/NF-kappa-B p65 thereby inhibiting its transactivating potential and augments apoptosis in response to TNF-alpha. Deacetylates HIF1A, KAT5/TIP60, RB1 and HIC1. Deacetylates FOXO1 resulting in its nuclear retention and enhancement of its transcriptional activity leading to increased gluconeogenesis in liver. Inhibits E2F1 transcriptional activity and apoptotic function, possibly by deacetylation. Involved in HES1- and HEY2-mediated transcriptional repression. In cooperation with MYCN seems to be involved in transcriptional repression of DUSP6/MAPK3 leading to MYCN stabilization by phosphorylation at 'Ser-62'. Deacetylates MEF2D. Required for antagonist-mediated transcription suppression of AR-dependent genes which may be linked to local deacetylation of histone H3. Represses HNF1A-mediated transcription. Required for the repression of ESRRG by CREBZF. Deacetylates NR1H3 AND NR1H2 and deacetylation of NR1H3 at 'Lys-434' positively regulates transcription of NR1H3:RXR target genes, promotes NR1H3 proteasomal degradation and results in cholesterol efflux; a promoter clearing mechanism after reach round of transcription is proposed. Involved in lipid metabolism: deacetylates LPIN1, thereby inhibiting diacylglycerol synthesis. Implicated in regulation of adipogenesis and fat mobilization in white adipocytes by repression of PPARG which probably involves association with NCOR1 and SMRT/NCOR2. Deacetylates p300/EP300 and PRMT1. Deacetylates ACSS2 leading to its activation, and HMGCS1 deacetylation. Involved in liver and muscle metabolism. Through deacetylation and activation of PPARGC1A is required to activate fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle under low-glucose conditions and is involved in glucose homeostasis. Involved in regulation of PPARA and fatty acid beta-oxidation in liver. Involved in positive regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells in response to glucose; the function seems to imply transcriptional repression of UCP2. Proposed to deacetylate IRS2 thereby facilitating its insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Deacetylates SREBF1 isoform SREBP-1C thereby decreasing its stability and transactivation in lipogenic gene expression. Involved in DNA damage response by repressing genes which are involved in DNA repair, such as XPC and TP73, deacetylating XRCC6/Ku70, and facilitating recruitment of additional factors to sites of damaged DNA, such as SIRT1-deacetylated NBN can recruit ATM to initiate DNA repair and SIRT1-deacetylated XPA interacts with RPA2. Also involved in DNA repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination and specifically single-strand annealing independently of XRCC6/Ku70 and NBN. Promotes DNA double-strand breaks by mediating deacetylation of SIRT6. Transcriptional suppression of XPC probably involves an E2F4:RBL2 suppressor complex and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling. Transcriptional suppression of TP73 probably involves E2F4 and PCAF. Deacetylates WRN thereby regulating its helicase and exonuclease activities and regulates WRN nuclear translocation in response to DNA damage. Deacetylates APEX1 at 'Lys-6' and 'Lys-7' and stimulates cellular AP endonuclease activity by promoting the association of APEX1 to XRCC1. Catalyzes deacetylation of ERCC4/XPF, thereby impairing interaction with ERCC1 and nucleotide excision repair (NER). Increases p53/TP53-mediated transcription-independent apoptosis by blocking nuclear translocation of cytoplasmic p53/TP53 and probably redirecting it to mitochondria. Deacetylates XRCC6/Ku70 at 'Lys-539' and 'Lys-542' causing it to sequester BAX away from mitochondria thereby inhibiting stress-induced apoptosis. Is involved in autophagy, presumably by deacetylating ATG5, ATG7 and MAP1LC3B/ATG8. Deacetylates AKT1 which leads to enhanced binding of AKT1 and PDK1 to PIP3 and promotes their activation. Proposed to play role in regulation of STK11/LBK1-dependent AMPK signaling pathways implicated in cellular senescence which seems to involve the regulation of the acetylation status of STK11/LBK1. Can deacetylate STK11/LBK1 and thereby increase its activity, cytoplasmic localization and association with STRAD; however, the relevance of such activity in normal cells is unclear. In endothelial cells is shown to inhibit STK11/LBK1 activity and to promote its degradation. Deacetylates SMAD7 at 'Lys-64' and 'Lys-70' thereby promoting its degradation. Deacetylates CIITA and augments its MHC class II transactivation and contributes to its stability. Deacetylates MECOM/EVI1. Deacetylates PML at 'Lys-487' and this deacetylation promotes PML control of PER2 nuclear localization. During the neurogenic transition, represses selective NOTCH1-target genes through histone deacetylation in a BCL6-dependent manner and leading to neuronal differentiation. Regulates the circadian expression of several core clock genes, including BMAL1, RORC, PER2 and CRY1 and plays a critical role in maintaining a controlled rhythmicity in histone acetylation, thereby contributing to circadian chromatin remodeling. Deacetylates BMAL1 and histones at the circadian gene promoters in order to facilitate repression by inhibitory components of the circadian oscillator. Deacetylates PER2, facilitating its ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Protects cardiomyocytes against palmitate-induced apoptosis. Deacetylates XBP1 isoform 2; deacetylation decreases protein stability of XBP1 isoform 2 and inhibits its transcriptional activity. Deacetylates PCK1 and directs its activity toward phosphoenolpyruvate production promoting gluconeogenesis. Involved in the CCAR2-mediated regulation of PCK1 and NR1D1. Deacetylates CTNB1 at 'Lys-49'. In POMC (pro-opiomelanocortin) neurons, required for leptin-induced activation of PI3K signaling. In addition to protein deacetylase activity, also acts as a protein-lysine deacylase by mediating protein depropionylation and decrotonylation. Mediates depropionylation of Osterix (SP7). Catalyzes decrotonylation of histones; it however does not represent a major histone decrotonylase. Deacetylates SOX9; promoting SOX9 nuclear localization and transactivation activity. Involved in the regulation of centrosome duplication. Deacetylates CENATAC in G1 phase, allowing for SASS6 accumulation on the centrosome and subsequent procentriole assembly (By similarity).

Acts as a part of the canonical IKK complex in the conventional pathway of NF-kappa-B activation (PubMed:9346484). Phosphorylates inhibitors of NF-kappa-B on 2 critical serine residues (PubMed:20434986, PubMed:20797629, PubMed:21138416, PubMed:9346484). These modifications allow polyubiquitination of the inhibitors and subsequent degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:20434986, PubMed:20797629, PubMed:21138416, PubMed:9346484). In turn, free NF-kappa-B is translocated into the nucleus and activates the transcription of hundreds of genes involved in immune response, growth control, or protection against apoptosis (PubMed:20434986, PubMed:20797629, PubMed:21138416, PubMed:9346484). In addition to the NF-kappa-B inhibitors, phosphorylates several other components of the signaling pathway including NEMO/IKBKG, NF-kappa-B subunits RELA and NFKB1, as well as IKK-related kinases TBK1 and IKBKE (PubMed:11297557, PubMed:14673179, PubMed:20410276, PubMed:21138416). IKK-related kinase phosphorylations may prevent the overproduction of inflammatory mediators since they exert a negative regulation on canonical IKKs (PubMed:11297557, PubMed:20410276, PubMed:21138416). Phosphorylates FOXO3, mediating the TNF-dependent inactivation of this pro-apoptotic transcription factor (PubMed:15084260). Also phosphorylates other substrates including NAA10, NCOA3, BCL10 and IRS1 (PubMed:17213322, PubMed:19716809). Phosphorylates RIPK1 at 'Ser-25' which represses its kinase activity and consequently prevents TNF-mediated RIPK1-dependent cell death (By similarity). Phosphorylates the C-terminus of IRF5, stimulating IRF5 homodimerization and translocation into the nucleus (PubMed:25326418). Following bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TLR4 endocytosis, phosphorylates STAT1 at 'Thr-749' which restricts interferon signaling and anti-inflammatory responses and promotes innate inflammatory responses (PubMed:38621137). IKBKB-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1 at 'Thr-749' promotes binding of STAT1 to the ARID5A promoter, resulting in transcriptional activation of ARID5A and subsequent ARID5A-mediated stabilization of IL6 (PubMed:32209697). It also promotes binding of STAT1 to the IL12B promoter and activation of IL12B transcription (PubMed:32209697)"

The free DNA strand then rotates around the intact phosphodiester bond on the opposing strand, thus removing DNA supercoils. Finally, in the religation step, the DNA 5'-OH attacks the covalent intermediate to expel the active-site tyrosine and restore the DNA phosphodiester backbone (By similarity).

    "description": "Molecular chaperone that promotes the maturation, structural maintenance and proper regulation of specific target proteins involved for instance in cell cycle control and signal transduction. Undergoes a functional cycle that is linked to its ATPase activity which is essential for its chaperone activity. This cycle probably induces conformational changes in the client proteins, thereby causing their activation. Interacts dynamically with various co-chaperones that modulate its substrate recognition, ATPase cycle and chaperone function (PubMed:11274138, PubMed:12526792, PubMed:15577939, PubMed:15937123, PubMed:27353360, PubMed:29127155). Engages with a range of client protein classes via its interaction with various co-chaperone proteins or complexes, that act as adapters, simultaneously able to interact with the specific client and the central chaperone itself (PubMed:29127155). Recruitment of ATP and co-chaperone followed by client protein forms a functional chaperone. After the completion of the chaperoning process, properly folded client protein and co-chaperone leave HSP90 in an ADP-bound partially open conformation and finally, ADP is released from HSP90 which acquires an open conformation for the next cycle (PubMed:26991466, PubMed:27295069). Plays a critical role in mitochondrial import, delivers preproteins to the mitochondrial import receptor TOMM70 (PubMed:12526792). Apart from its chaperone activity, it also plays a role in the regulation of the transcription machinery. HSP90 and its co-chaperones modulate transcription at least at three different levels (PubMed:25973397). In the first place, they alter the steady-state levels of certain transcription factors in response to various physiological cues (PubMed:25973397). Second, they modulate the activity of certain epigenetic modifiers, such as histone deacetylases or DNA methyl transferases, and thereby respond to the change in the environment (PubMed:25973397). Third, they participate in the eviction of histones from the promoter region of certain genes and thereby turn on gene expression (PubMed:25973397). Binds bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and mediates LPS-induced inflammatory response, including TNF secretion by monocytes (PubMed:11276205). Antagonizes STUB1-mediated inhibition of TGF-beta signaling via inhibition of STUB1-mediated SMAD3 ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:24613385). Mediates the association of TOMM70 with IRF3 or TBK1 in mitochondrial outer membrane which promotes host antiviral response (PubMed:20628368, PubMed:25609812)"

TORC1 positively controls protein biosynthesis by regulation of mRNA stability, translation initiation factor activity, and high-affinity amino acid permeases that serve to provide amino acids for use by the translation machinery. TORC1 also promotes growth by sequestering a number of nutrient and general stress-responsive transcription factors in the cytoplasm. TORC1 negatively controls macroautophagy, a process to recycle surplus cytoplasmic mass under nutrient starvation conditions.
